	<description><![CDATA[<b>ABOUT</b>

Although it has been thousands of years since <i>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</i> last aired, the show is once again enjoying a resurgence, though how it came to the rim remains a mystery. Regardless of the hows and whys, many residents have embraced the show, as the colourful characters and messages of peace, hope and friendship help them to escape the struggles of trying to survive daily life in their colonies. Many of them have taken to carrying plushies of the main characters with them, with some even claiming that they feel as though a part of the character lives within the plush, which is then transferred to them.

Nonetheless, the craze has caught on, and now pony plushies are as much a part of everyday rim life as food and guns.

<b>WHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?</b>

This mod adds plush versions of the Mane Six - and my OC because this <i>is</i> my mod after all - which can be carried in the utility slot to confer bonuses depending on which pony it is.

Applejack: +10% to plant work speed and harvest yield.
Fluttershy: +5% to animal gather speed, gather yield, tame chance and training chance.
Pinkie Pie: +10% to social impact and trade price improvement.
Rainbow Dash: +10% to movement speed and +5% to melee hit chance and shooting accuracy.
Rarity: +10% to mining speed, +5 to pawn beauty, and +5% to trade price improvment.
Twilight Sparkle: +20% research speed.

Nurse Haywick (my OC): +20% to medical tend speed.

<b>CAN YOU ADD *CHARACTER* TO THIS?</b>

Sorry, but no; as much as I would love to add other characters, I don't want to clog the game with loads of new items. Plus, I'd have a hard time figuring out what bonuses each character could give.
